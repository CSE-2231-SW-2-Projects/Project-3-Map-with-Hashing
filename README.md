# Project-3-Map-with-Hashing

Complete and carefully test implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface MapKernel, building the data structure representing a Map object by layering it on top of an array of (perhaps surprisingly) Map itself. The algorithmic approach is to use hashing to immediately narrow every search to a much smaller Map.
